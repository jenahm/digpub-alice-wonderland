				<blockquote epub:type="epigraph">

					All in the golden afternoon <br>

					Full leisurely we glide; <br>

					For both our oars, with little skill, <br>

					By little arms are plied; <br>

					While little hands make vain pretence <br>

					Our wanderings to guide. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour, <br>

					Beneath such dreamy weather, <br>

					To beg a tale of breath too weak <br>

					To stir the tiniest feather! <br>

					Yet what can one poor voice avail <br>

					Against three tongues together? <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Imperious Prima flashes forth <br>

					Her edict “to begin it”: <br>

					In gentler tones Secunda hopes <br>

					“There will be nonsense in it.” <br>

					While Tertia interrupts the tale <br>

					Not _more_ than once a minute. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Anon, to sudden silence won, <br>

					In fancy they pursue <br>

					The dream-child moving through a land <br>

					Of wonders wild and new, <br>

					In friendly chat with bird or beast⁠— <br>

					And half believe it true. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					And ever, as the story drained <br>

					The wells of fancy dry, <br>

					And faintly strove that weary one <br>

					To put the subject by, <br>

					“The rest next time⁠—” “It _is_ next time!” <br>

					The happy voices cry. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus grew the tale of Wonderland: <br>

					Thus slowly, one by one, <br>

					Its quaint events were hammered out⁠— <br>

					And now the tale is done, <br>

					And home we steer, a merry crew, <br>

					Beneath the setting sun. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Alice! A childish story take, <br>

					And with a gentle hand <br>

					Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined <br>

					In Memory’s mystic band, <br>

					Like pilgrim’s withered wreath of flowers <br>

					Pluck’d in a far-off land. <br>
				</p>
