          <section class="first-line">All in the golden afternoon <br /></section>

  				<section class="indent-line">Full leisurely we glide; <br /></section>

					For both our oars, with little skill, <br />

					<section class="indent-line">By little arms are plied; <br /></section>

					While little hands make vain pretence <br />

					<section class="indent-line">Our wanderings to guide. <br /></section>
</p>
<p>
    			<section class="first-line">Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour, <br /></section>

					<section class="indent-line">Beneath such dreamy weather, <br /></section>

					To beg a tale of breath too weak <br />

					<section class="indent-line">To stir the tiniest feather! <br /></section>

					Yet what can one poor voice avail <br />

					<section class="indent-line">Against three tongues together? <br /></section>

          <section class="first-line">Imperious Prima flashes forth <br /></section>

					<section class="indent-line">Her edict “to begin it”: <br /></section>

					In gentler tones Secunda hopes <br />

					<section class="indent-line">“There will be nonsense in it.” <br /></section>

					While Tertia interrupts the tale <br />

					<section class="indent-line">Not <em>more</em> than once a minute. <br /></section>
</p>
<p>
  				<section class="first-line">Anon, to sudden silence won, <br /></section>

					<section class="indent-line">In fancy they pursue <br /></section>

					The dream-child moving through a land <br />

					<section class="indent-line">Of wonders wild and new, <br /></section>

					In friendly chat with bird or beast⁠— <br />

					<section class="indent-line">And half believe it true.<br /></section>
</p>
<p>
					<section class="first-line">And ever, as the story drained <br /></section>

					<section class="indent-line">The wells of fancy dry, <br /></section>

					And faintly strove that weary one <br />

					<section class="indent-line">To put the subject by, <br /></section>

					“The rest next time⁠—” “It <em>is</em> next time!” <br />

					<section class="indent-line">The happy voices cry. <br /></section>
</p>
<p>
					<section class="first-line">Thus grew the tale of Wonderland: <br /></section>

					<section class="indent-line">Thus slowly, one by one, <br /></section>

					Its quaint events were hammered out⁠— <br />

					<section class="indent-line">And now the tale is done, <br /></section>

					And home we steer, a merry crew, <br />

					<section class="indent-line">Beneath the setting sun. <br /></section>

        	<section class="first-line">Alice! A childish story take, <br /></section>

        	<section class="indent-line">And with a gentle hand <br /></section>

					Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined <br />

        	<section class="indent-line">In Memory’s mystic band, <br /></section>

					Like pilgrim’s withered wreath of flowers <br />

        	<section class="indent-line">Pluck’d in a far-off land. <br /></section>
